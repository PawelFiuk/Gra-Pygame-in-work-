# Steampunk Platformer Game

Welcome to the Steampunk Platformer project! This is an ongoing game development project utilizing Python and Pygame. Currently, the game is in the development phase, where I try to craft an immersive experience set in a steampunk-inspired world.

## Overview

In this game, players control the main character in a platformer environment. The character has the ability to shoot, gain experience points, and allocate skill points.
